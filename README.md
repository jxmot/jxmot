# `WELCOME!`

Thanks for stopping by!

## `WHOAMI`

I'm Jim, a software engineer with 30+ years of experience. I've worked on everything from embedded industrial controls and custom home automation & building controls to slot machines and consumer software. I've seen technologies come and go, as well as programming languages. 

I am *progressive*, I am constantly learning new things. And I'm not limited to just writing software. Although my interests are definitely technical in nature. And I've recently started 3D printing and it's been an interesting journey!

My past(some are still current) interests include: *analog* photography, amateur radio, electronics, travel, outdoors, and my dog.

## `WHEREAMI`

Chicago, Illinois, United States. And more specifically you'll find me in my home office working on one project or another.

## `WHATIDO`
</summary>
<p>

A non-technical very good friend once asked me "*What do you do exactly?*". I thought about it for a moment and was about to give an answer that was most likely way too detailed for my friend. So instead I told them "*I create things you cannot see, but you can see the effect they have*".

Well, the next question from my friend wasn't surprising... "*What the heck does THAT mean?*".

### `WHATITMEANS`

So I realized that my friend might understand if I tried explaining this way....

*Just about every human-made thing is comprised of *layers*. The part that is visible is just the top layer, *someone* had to create the layers that form what you see now.*

### `HOWIDOIT`

My years of experience have taught me some very useful skills. So I would like to share them with you...

**Comment your code.**

Even the "professionals" like to avoid code commenting. It's a mistake to not comment, it's even worse if comments are out of date or are out of context. Make code commenting part of your work flow. It should be as natural to you as coding itself.
<br>

**You're not always right, even if you can prove it.**

Yes, it's true! Many times "being right" is a matter of perspective. And don't take it personally when someone tells you that you're wrong. Look at it that moment an opportunity to expand your mind and see things in a new way. And if you find that you were wrong, stand up and admit it.
<br><br>

**Document your work...**

...thoughts, design process, hurdles, accomplishments, etc. It's not just for others to see what you have done or how you did it. It's for **you** too. And just because you created a magnificent application it doesn't mean squat if you don't describe it in some way. If your work was targeted for users then write a *good* user manual.
<br><br>

**Don't assume.**

Just because you understand what you did does not mean others will. 
<br><br>

**Great != Complicated**

I can't tell you how many times I've seen developers(or engineers) create something what was **way too complicated** just to prove *how smart they are*. More times than not, greatness is born from simplicity.
<br><br>

**Ship It!**

Have you ever seen anything human-made that is *perfect*? No, probably not. And even if you have, that perfection is often temporary. And quite often the (*preceived*) perfection is created from *acceptance of "what is"*.
<br><br>

**Design, Code, **Test**, Rinse, Repeat**

This is a cycle that stays in motion even after the customer is *satisfied*.

## Strengths & Specialties

My strengths are in several areas. They include wide scope of trouble-shooting, adaptability, written communication, and learning new things. 

I have a background in *electronics hardware* and it has contributed to my skill set in a number of ways. I have found that I have a knack for ????


* I am detail driven. Evidence can be seen in the code I design and the project documentation that I create.
* I am accustomed to familiarizing myself with code written by others as quickly as possible. It is a skill I have used during my entire software engineering career.
* I am completely comfortable switching between languages, and front & back end. Some of my favorite projects include aspects of both.
* I am a firm believer code integrity. I test my code for edge cases and try to ensure that it behaves as intended.
* My standards for quality are steadfast. And I believe that code documentation is important, whether it is in the form of source file comments or stand-alone documents. In addition, I believe that *well formatted* code is just as important. 
* I am a born problem solver. My experiences have taught me to look even in the most unlikely of places when
seeking the origin of a bug.
* Collaboration has been a major part of my career. Every position I’ve held involved collaboration with other engineers, management, sales & marketing, *and the customer*.
