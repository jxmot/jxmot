# Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by!

## `WHOAMI`

I'm Jim, a software engineer with 30+ years of experience. I've worked on everything from embedded industrial controls to custom home automation & building controls. I've seen technologies come and go, as well as programming languages. 

I am *progressive*, I am constantly learning new things. And I'm not limited to just writing software. Although my interests are definitely technical in nature. And I've recently started 3D printing and it's been an interesting journey!

My past(some are still current) interests include: *analog* photography, amateur radio, electronics, travel, outdoors, and my dog.

## `WHEREAMI`

Chicago, Illinois, United States. And more specifically you'll find me in my home office working on one project or another.

## What I do

A non-technical good friend once asked me "*What do you do exactly?*". I thought about it for a moment and was about to give an answer that was most likely way too detailed for my friend. So instead I told them "*I create things you cannot see, but you can see the effect they have.*"

Well, the next question from my friend wasn't surprising... "*What the heck does THAT mean?*".

### How I do it

My years of experience have taught me some very useful developer skills:

* Comment your code: Even the "professionals" like to avoid commenting. It's a mistake to not comment, it's even worse if comments are out of date or are out of context. Make code commenting part of your work flow. It should be as natural to you as coding itself. Use easy to find "tags" to find *certain types of comments* like
* 
* You're not always right, even if you can prove it: 
* Document your work, thoughts, design process, hurdles, accomplishments, etc: Just because you wrote a magnificent application it doesn't mean squat if you don't describe it in some way. If your work was targeted for users then write a *good* user manual. 
* Don't assume: Just because you understand what you did does not mean others will. Take an approach that assumes your reader(s) need some background info.
* Design, Test, Rinse, Repeat:
* Keep the project ALIVE: 
* Keep it Simple(as needed):
*
